  abstract	= {Let Σ be a finite alphabet, Σ* the free monoid generated
		  by Σ and χ the length of χ ∈ Σ*. For any integer k0,
		  fk(χ) (tk(χ)) is χ if χ {\textless} k + 1, and it is
		  the prefix (suffix) of χ of length k, othewise. Also let
		  mk+1(χ) = {νχ = uνw and ν = k+1}. For χ, y ε Σ*
		  define χ ∼ k+1 y iff fk(χ) = fk(y), tk(χ) = tk(y) and
		  mk+1(χ) = mk+1(y). The relation ∼k+1 is a congruence of
		  finite index over Σ*. An event E ⊆ Σ* is (k+1)-testable
		  iff it is a union of congruence classes of ∼k+1. E is
		  locally testable (LT) if it is k+1-testable for some k.
		  (This definition differs from that of [6] but is
		  equivalent.) We show that the family of LT events is a
		  proper sub-family of star-free events of dot-depth 1. LT
		  events and k-testable events are characterized in terms of
		  (a) restricted star-free expressions based on finite and
		  cofinite events; (b) finite automata accepting these
		  events; (c) semigroups; and (d) structural decomposition of
		  such automata. Algorithms are given for deciding whether a
		  regular event is (a) LT and (b) k+1-testable. Generalized
		  definite events are also characterized.},
